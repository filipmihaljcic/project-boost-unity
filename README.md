# Project Boost Game 

This game is simple prototype built on foundation of [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/).
It's fairly simple game that is open for more ideas and stuff. Game uses basic collisons and particle system. The game also uses moving 
script, collision script and oscillator script which moves obstacles using sinusoid wave logic. There are some textures here and there to 
spice things up.
